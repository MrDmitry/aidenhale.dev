# No true Agile

I've spent 8 years working under some manifestation of Agile methodology:
* Kanban
* Scrum
* LeSS
* SAFe

All of these years I had some [Agile shaman](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-Agile) herding me around and boasting to
management how much the team did. There was always more boasting than actual work completed.

Every time I criticized Agile, even in a constructive manner "_that specific thing just didn't work for us_", I got to
hear the staple "well you just didn't Agile right". Ugh.

As with most popular things, the underlying values and ideas behind Agile are pretty cool:
* learn what your user wants
* don't lock yourself into bad decisions, be flexible
* try delivering frequently, it helps to idenify bad decisions
* talk to management, not only devs
* empower colleagues
* take some time to reflect on your workflows

Cool values, but **apparently** everyone gets them wrong.

# An illusion of work

One of the few things Agile excels at is generating endless burn charts that mean something to some people.

If I were to draft an Agile manifesto based on what our Agile shamans did, it would look like this:
* **do what customer asks**
* **don't bother with requirements**
* **underpromise and deliver something**
* **motivate through gamification**
* **punish self-motivation by piling on responsibilities**
* **ensure "temporary hacks for a demo" become permanent**
* **never fix old hacks - you can't demo the same thing twice**
* **schedule some more meetings**
* **committees are the only way forward**

Maybe that is what bothers me the most - meetings and committees.

They say "every meeting has to have a purpose" but let a meeting become recurring and it becomes a ritual. A couple of
weeks go by and your day is 40% meetings that you "listen-in just in case, oh and provide some feedback when you can".

Then they pump out committees faster than teams deliver features:
* **Steering Committee** to decide what fire to start on any particular week
* **Architecture Review** to hold Whiteboard Anonymous meetings
* **Change Control Board** because Whiteboard Anonymous got too crowded
* **Release Management** to try and find the difference between the releases to sell to the customer
* **Scrum Teams** to hold Agile Anonymous meetings

And that's just the first week! Next week they'll create a committee to oversee the QA, security, documentation, code
formatting, tool selection and of course a committee to oversee the other committees.

What happened to "letting people talk to each other"? _They are talking, look at how many meetings we have_

Do we really need to create "spaces for people to talk at"? _It's facilitation, silly_

Do we really need to obfuscate decision making? _Committees know best!_

Do we really need to gamify work to "make it engaging and motivating"? _But it's fun!_

# A message to the shaman

Stop treating your colleagues like kids.

You want to motivate developers? Give them clear goals, interesting problems, involve them in decision-making,
recognize their work.

You want people talking to each other - let them try. Don't "facilitate" their communication - it's extremely important
for people to learn when and how to reach out to other people.

Every "Agile" project I worked at had a problem of people "collecting things for the stand-up". They do some work,
encounter some problem and **stop working altogether** because now they have something for the tomorrow's call.

Promote effective communications. Recognize when developer delivers something. Involve motivated people in design, let
them feel a **part** of their project, not a **cog** in a machine.

# A message to the managers

Stop micromanaging. I know how fun it is to "solve other people's problems", but you're not allowing people to grow.

Identify champions in the team. Involve them when there are battles to be had:
* when you're pressed on technical details, involve your technical champion
* when you're pressed on quality, involve your quality champion
* when you're pressed on process, throw your shaman under the bus

Not only will your champions be the best representatives for the corresponding areas, they will feel recognized and,
hopefully, appreciated.

Give and gather feedback. Listen to concerns, collect ideas, resolve conflicts. Know what's in your power and make sure
your colleagues know what you can do.

Don't be afraid to let people go. Don't abuse it, but if a person doesn't want to change or is not aligned with the
team, it could be in everyone's best interest for them to find a different project.

# A message to the devs

Be the change you want to see in your project.

Don't treat your work like a "clock-in / clock-out" - you spend half the day with your colleagues, promote good vibes.

Stop "just kicking the can down the road" even if your shaman tells you to. Always look at a bigger picture when
kicking the can - you want to kick it in the right direction.

Let your manager know if you want interesting problems (or if you're not 

Let your manager know if you want to do things "outside of your role" (public speaking, conferences, open source).

Ask for clarifications if something is not clear, don't wait and guess.

Ask for help without waiting for "the next stand-up". Offer help when able.

Speak up if you don't like something about your work. Don't vent, just talk to those in charge, be it shaman or manager.

If you're in senior/lead/architect position - allocate time for emails. If you don't want to attend some meeting,
suggest resolving it via email and provide your inputs immediately. Quite often an email is enough, but even if not -
you're already driving the conversation where you want it.

Learn when to take responsibility and when to let others take it.
