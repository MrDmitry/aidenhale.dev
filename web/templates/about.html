            <p>Hello, I'm Aiden! I'm a software engineer with a focus on backend, tooling and infrastructure.</p>

            <p>I started my career in the web/app development back in 2009 and soon transitioned to embedded C++. I
                learned a lot about working within limited ecosystems and how to work around the limitations via
                tooling. I got to apply these things in a number of architecture-type gigs for major players in the
                automotive industry. Eventually I got to create a greenfield build- and release-infrastructure project
                for the next-gen toolchain for a major automotive manufacturer.</p>

            <p>I am deeply passionate about improving the development process and experience. My focus is on developing
                internal tools, streamlining processes through automation, fostering a supportive developer ecosystem,
                and sharing knowledge through mentoring.</p>

            <p>My goal for 2024 is to contribute to the broader developer community through open-source contributions
                and streaming.</p>
